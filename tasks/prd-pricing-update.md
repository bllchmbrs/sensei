# PRD: Pricing Structure Update

## Introduction/Overview

The current pricing structure in the web application has inconsistencies between different pricing components. There are two separate pricing sections (`presentation/pricing.tsx` and `about/pricing.tsx`) displaying different pricing tiers and structures. This creates confusion for users and undermines trust in the product. This PRD outlines the requirements for consolidating and updating the pricing structure to create a consistent, strategic, and user-friendly pricing experience.

**Problem:** Inconsistent pricing display across different sections of the website with conflicting pricing tiers and unclear value propositions.

**Goal:** Create a unified, consistent, and strategically designed pricing structure that clearly communicates value propositions and improves conversion rates.

## Goals

1. **Consistency:** Unify all pricing displays across the web application to show identical pricing information
2. **Clarity:** Improve pricing communication with clear feature differentiation and value propositions  
3. **Conversion:** Optimize pricing structure to improve user conversion rates
4. **Maintainability:** Create a centralized pricing configuration system for easy updates
5. **User Experience:** Ensure pricing information is accessible, clear, and professional across all devices

## User Stories

- **As a potential customer**, I want to see consistent pricing information throughout the website so that I can trust the company and make informed decisions
- **As a business owner**, I want to easily compare different pricing tiers so that I can choose the plan that best fits my needs
- **As a developer**, I want to update pricing information in one place so that all pricing displays are automatically synchronized
- **As a marketing manager**, I want to highlight key features and benefits in each pricing tier so that users understand the value they're getting
- **As a mobile user**, I want to view pricing information clearly on my device so that I can make purchasing decisions on any screen size

## Functional Requirements

1. **Unified Pricing Structure**: The system must display identical pricing tiers and amounts across all pricing components
2. **Centralized Configuration**: The system must use a centralized pricing configuration file that feeds all pricing displays
3. **Feature Comparison**: The system must clearly display feature differences between pricing tiers with visual indicators (checkmarks, icons)
4. **Payment Integration**: The system must maintain existing Paddle payment integration for seamless checkout
5. **Responsive Design**: The system must display pricing information clearly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
6. **Call-to-Action Buttons**: The system must include prominent, accessible call-to-action buttons for each pricing tier
7. **Popular Plan Highlighting**: The system must visually highlight the recommended/popular pricing tier
8. **Pricing Flexibility**: The system must support easy updates to pricing amounts without code changes
9. **Feature Toggle**: The system must allow enabling/disabling specific features per pricing tier
10. **Loading States**: The system must display appropriate loading states while pricing information loads

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Dynamic pricing based on user location or usage
- A/B testing framework for different pricing strategies (will be addressed in a future iteration)
- Integration with additional payment providers beyond Paddle
- Subscription management dashboard (separate feature)
- Automatic pricing tier recommendations based on user behavior
- Multi-currency support (future iteration)

## Design Considerations

- **Component Reusability**: Create a single, reusable pricing component that can be used across different pages
- **Material Tailwind Integration**: Maintain consistency with existing Material Tailwind design system
- **Accessibility**: Ensure pricing tables meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use typography, spacing, and color to create clear visual hierarchy
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Present pricing information in digestible chunks without overwhelming users

## Technical Considerations

- **Configuration Management**: Implement a TypeScript configuration file for pricing data
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all pricing data is properly typed for development safety
- **Component Architecture**: Design components to be easily testable and maintainable
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and minimal bundle size impact
- **Astro Integration**: Ensure components work properly with Astro's SSG/SSR architecture
- **Paddle Integration**: Maintain existing Paddle checkout functionality

## Success Metrics

- **Consistency Score**: 100% alignment of pricing information across all pages (measured through automated testing)
- **Conversion Rate**: 15% improvement in pricing page to checkout conversion rate
- **User Engagement**: 25% increase in time spent on pricing sections
- **Developer Efficiency**: 80% reduction in time needed to update pricing information
- **Error Reduction**: 100% elimination of pricing discrepancy issues
- **Page Load Performance**: Maintain or improve current page load speeds

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement a pricing comparison feature to show competitor pricing?
2. What is the preferred pricing tier structure (current 3-tier vs. 4-tier vs. other)?
3. Should we include annual vs. monthly pricing options?
4. What are the priority markets for potential future multi-currency support?
5. Should we implement usage-based pricing for any tiers?
6. What level of customization should be available for enterprise customers?
