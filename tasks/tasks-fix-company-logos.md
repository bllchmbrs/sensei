## Relevant Files

- `src/components/presentation/logos.tsx` - Logo section component that displays company logos under "Powered by Adobe Creative Cloud" heading.
- `public/logos/` - Directory containing the actual company logo SVG files (amazon, microsoft, ibm, salesforce, vodafone, cisco).

### Notes

- The issue states logos are broken under "Powered by Adobe Creative Cloud" section
- Available logo files in public/logos/ are: logo-amazon.svg, logo-microsoft.svg, logo-ibm.svg, logo-salesforce.svg, logo-vodafone.svg, logo-cisco.svg, logo-united-nations.svg
- Current logos array in component references Adobe product logos (photoshop, illustrator, etc.) that don't exist as files
- Need to update the logos array to reference the existing company logo files
