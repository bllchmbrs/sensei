## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ CHANGELOG.MD
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ css

â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ astro-launch-ui.min.js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ scss
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ loading-dot.css
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ create-free-demo.js
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/

â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ example.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ header.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 404.astro
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ landing.astro
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ login.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
