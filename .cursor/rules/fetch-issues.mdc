Use the GitHub issues list function to list any open issues on the GitHub repository bllchmbrs/sensei. If the item is a pull request, please ignore it, we ONLY want to look at issues, not pull requests.

When you find an open issue, you please list the comments on that issue.

After that, you must create a fix specification for each 'problem' (note, there may be more than one problem per issue for example a comment might call out a particular issue). 

This problem description(s) must be complete and most not require referring to the specific issue to get more information.
