# Image Base URL Rule

All image URLs in this project must use the base URL `/astro-launch-ui/` at the root of the sitepath. For example, an image located at `public/logos/logo-facebook.png` should be referenced as `/astro-launch-ui/logos/logo-facebook.png` in your code or markdown.

This ensures that images resolve correctly regardless of deployment context or subdirectory hosting.
